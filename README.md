# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

// Issues

- give fixed height to profile image
- fix container's margin --- see why the layout's main container is not respecting the margin set by container. fix it
- set color: var(--wc-white); to remove blue color on profile's social icons.
- see how you're goin to scroll on mobile - remember we're using react router in desktop - how're we going to implement same
- content on mobile - also implementing smooth jump to page section
